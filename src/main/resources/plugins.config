 # <p>
 # The Combined Grids Plugin is based on the Grid Plugin (<a target="_blank"
 # href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/grid.html"
 # >http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/grid.html</a>) originally written by Dr
 # Wayne Rasband and modified with his permission.
 # This package also includes the Grid Switch Plugin to work with the Combined Grids Plugin
 # </p>
 # 
 # <p>
 # Implemented Functions:
 # <ol>
 # <li>Combined, or multi-purpose, point grid with several fine to coarse grid
 # ratios</li>
 # <li>Double lattice square grid with several fine to coarse grid ratios</li>
 # <li>Output of grid parameters</li>
 # <li>Manual specification of grid position</li>
 # <li>Overlay/remove a grid without destroying the other Overlay elements</li>
 # <li>Check box to choose if you want to launch the Grid Switch Plugin</li>
 # <li>Grid Switch to temporary hide an overlaid grid</li>
 # </ol>
 # </p>
 # 
 # <p>
 # Installation and Usage:
 # <ol>
 # <li>Put "CombinedGridPlugin.jar" into the plugins folder of ImageJ (or
 # Fiji) and restart the software. Please note that this does
 # <strong>NOT</strong> overwrite or replace the existing Grid plugin installed
 # with ImageJ.</li>
 # <li>Open an image in ImageJ.</li>
 # <li>Choose "Plugins" > "Grids" > "Combined Grids" in ImageJ.</li>
 # <li>Specify your grid settings in the dialog box and click OK.</li>
 # </ol>
 # </p>
 # 
 # <p>
 # Notes for the Combined Grids Plugin:
 # <ol>
 # <li>For the Combined Point Grid and the Double Lattice Square grid,
 # "Area per Point" determines density of the fine grid.</li>
 # <li>Grid location by "Fixed Position" in this plugin is same as grid location
 # with "random-offset" unchecked in the original "Grid" plugin. For
 # "Combined Point" and "Double Lattice" grids, the first point of the coarse
 # grid is placed on the first point for the fine grid at the left upper corner.
 # </li>
 # </ol>
 # </p>
 # <p>
 # Notes for the Grid Switch Plugin:
 # <ol>
 # <li>This plugin specifically hides/redraws a grid overlaid by the "Grid with Combined Grids" plugin.</li>
 # <li>When it redraws a grid, the grid is placed on the top of all the other elements of the overlay.</li>
 # <li>You can have multiple grid switches.</li>
 # <li>It works for a currently active image. If you have multiple images with grids, you can change the target of the grid switch by activating another image.</li>
 # <li>When the grid switch looses its window focus, the grid is redrawn.</li>
 # </ol>
